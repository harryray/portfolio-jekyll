# portfolio-jekyll
Jekyll portion of portfolio. This features a much more in-depth exploration of what Jekyll can do, including structural theme alterations and styling updates. I've explored some of the options in `_config.yml` through experimentation in my main hub repo, but I might be making changes in here too.
